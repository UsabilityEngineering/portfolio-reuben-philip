  <h1> Immaculate Grid </h1>
</div>

As a sports fan and a fan of puzzle games, Immaculate Grid is a perfect game for me. It combines the aspect of sports that you love with the challenge of puzzle-solving. The game is very simple, it's a 3x3 grid with each row and column that has a team from the particular sport or an achievement you can get in the sport, such as “10 touchdown season.” The goal of the game is to fill each spot with a player who satisfies both the requirements of the particular row and column.

For example, today's grid is the picture above. As you can see, it is a 3x3 grid, and for today's grid, each row and column has a different sports team in the NFL. I decided to think about the **visual hierarchy** of the game and found out that it is a very simple hierarchy, but it is very efficient. If you are a new user, the main thing that draws your attention is the grid in the middle of the page, drawing the user's attention to the game itself at first glance. I was then noticed the nav bar at the topic since the color of the texts are a different color (blue) which allows you to play the different versions of the games and then after right below the nav bar in a lower font but same blue highlight is the miscellaneous things of the website such as a stats page, rules, and the answers to today's grids. One thing I did notice was that I didn't realize the note underneath the grid that speaks about the rules until a long while after. I think this because the grid is so eye-catching, and the text underneath doesn't have any special color or underlining that catches the eye, which goes unnoticed.

Looking at all the buttons and labels, the page has high **affordance** for the user. I did not find myself questioning what any of the buttons did. I also found the **mental model** of the game to be very **learnable**. Personally, I did not find myself questioning how to start playing the game, but I can also see how someone who has never played a game like this takes some time to figure out how to get started.

Before I started the game, I decided to look at the rules to see how to play the game properly, and I was really surprised by how in-depth they went into the rules. Every question of the game, such as “3000+ YDS Passing,” for example, has an in-depth description of what the player must have accomplished to be considered for that question.

After reading the rules, I started playing the game. I first chose a square to guess a player for that category. As you can see from the picture, I decided to choose the first square where I have to guess a player who has played for the Detroit Lions and the Cincinnati Bengals in their career in the NFL. When clicking on a square, a search bar appears at the top of your screen, allowing you to make a guess. I really like how it highlights the square you are guessing, so you don't get confused, and when you are guessing a player, there is a nice touch of the years the players were in the NFL, so you don’t get confused if multiple players have the same name.

I made a guess, and as you can see, it fills the square with the player's image to show you that the square has been completed, and you can move on to the next square. On thing that I did not know about is when you guess a player there is a percentage on the image which I didn't know what it meant but I later found out that the percentage means the likelihood of that player being guessed for that square compared to all the other players that are also eligible for that square, mean the lower the percentage the more obscure your guess was. Another thing that was interesting to see was that with every guess correct or wrong, the counter on the right side of the grid goes down, showing the user the status of their game.

I moved on to another square in the grid and wanted to see what happens if you guess a player that you have already guessed or guess a player that is not eligible/correct for that particular square.
First, I guessed the same player I guessed for the first square, and it seems that his name pops up, but instead of the green guess button that usually pops up that attracts the user to make a guess, a normal grey text replaces the button, saying “Already used”. Then, when you guess a player who is not correct for the square, it highlights the player's name in red and decreases the guess counter.

Since this was a difficult grid for me, I clicked the “give up” button underneath the guess counter. This pops up a window that shows you the summary of the game, showing you the squares you got correct and the rarity score of your grid. One of the main confusions I had during the game was the rarity score. I thought the higher your rarity score (which ranges from 0-1000), the better your performance in the game, but it is actually the opposite; the lower your rarity score, the more obscure your guesses were. I think the **visual hierarchy** of this summary window is really good, where you have the grid as the largest item of the window, and then as you move lower down the window the smaller the text gets with the last thing on the window being a button that allows you to quit the game. I also like how the buttons “keep guessing” and “No thanks, maybe later” are a different color, which improves their **call to action**. I also think making the button that allows the user to keep playing have a border, and the button that allows the user to leave without having a border is a little change, but I think it greatly improves the **call to action** of the keep playing button because it draws the attention of the user more to keep playing.

I decided to click the button that leaves the game, and when doing that, it opens up a larger, more in-depth stat page that shows you stats such as the accuracy of each square on the grid and the most popular answer for each square on the grid

I wanted to play more but a different grid so I don't know the answers already but since this game is like wordle means that there is only one game per day I thought I couldn't but then I realized on the home page on the nav bar there was a previous grid button which I then clicked which took me to the page in the picture. It is a page with a chart with all of the grids that have ever been played, which includes the grid number, score (if you have played that grid before), and a play now text, all of which are borderless buttons with a different color. I then clicked on the play now button to start playing a different grid.
​
When analysing the UX of this website, I realized that gaming websites have to catch the users' attention and use different techniques, such as bordered and borderless buttons, like how this website did to keep the user playing their game. The website also has to be structured uniformly, and make sure that if you have different game modes available for the user to play, they have to be very similar because the user has a **mental model** in their head that you don't want to change. Since it can cause the user to leave because of confusion mean that the website also has to have a good **user flow** to keep the user on the website, which this website does have.
